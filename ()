Annotation functionality is fairly solid. 

Next steps are:
* Integrate with Django to support annotation of any text;
* Add support for sessions;
* Interface for selecting repositories, texts.

On the backend:
* Mechanisms for selecting texts from repositories;
* Mechanisms for text-prep prior to annotation;
* Export to Quadriga/QStore4s;
* Visualization/export of conjugate data.
